UTIL-PROCESS-Yet_another_Kill_utility
=====================================

KILL is a command-line process killer utility for OS/2 Warp (and possibly 2.1x).  It includes support for Holger Veit's xf86sup.sys, which (when used in conjunction with OS/2 Warp FixPak 17 (or later?)) implements a "HARD KILL" method.
